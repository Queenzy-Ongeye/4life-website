        <h3 class="text-center">Types of Assualts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Violence aganist Women and Girl</em> ==> GBV is disproportionately directed against women and girls
            [4]. For this reason, you may find that some definitions use GBV and VAWG interchangeably, and in this
            article, we focus mainly on VAWG.</li>
          <li><em>Violence aganist LGBTI people</em> ==> Violence against LGBTI people However, it is possible for
            people of all genders to be subject to GBV. For example, GBV is often experienced by people who are seen as
            not conforming to their assigned gender roles, such as lesbian, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex
            people.</li>
          <li><em>Intimate PArtner Violence</em> ==> IPV is the most common form of GBV and includes physical, sexual,
            and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by a current or former intimate partner or spouse, and can
            occur in heterosexual or same-sex couples [5].</li>
          <li><em>Domestic Violence</em>==> Domestic violence refers to violence which is carried out by partners or
            family members. As such, DV can include IPV, but also encompasses violence against children or other family
            members.</li>
          <li><em>Sexual Violence</em> ==> Sexual violence is “any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted
            sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using
            coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not
            limited to home and work.”</li>
          <li><em>Indirect (structual violence)</em> ==> Structural violence exists when certain groups, classes,
            genders or nationalities have privileged access to goods, resources and opportunities over others, and when
            this unequal advantage is built into the social, political and economic systems that govern their lives.”
